# GSDF HEADQUARTERS



The Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) is the heart of the entire Georgia State Defense Force. The units that make up HHC are located at Ellenwood Readiness Center and usually drill on the first full weekend of the month (known as Alpha weekend). HHC units lay the foundation for the Force to operate throughout the state of Georgia, helping our citizens and working closely with the National Guard to maintain military readiness.


The company comprises the following units:

Personnel (G1): We manage our people. Whether it’s promoting a soldier, awarding a medal, maintaining files, or tracking missions, G1 takes care of the people of the Force.

Intelligence (G2): Information is our stock and trade. We coordinate activities and systems that facilitate understanding of the threats, terrain and weather, and other relevant aspects of the operational environment for all missions, drills, and other Force activities.

Operations (G3): If you have strong skills in planning, overseeing operations, and developing training, G3 is for you. G3 coordinates various units of the Force, integrates information collection, and allocates resources for operations. We serve as the point of contact for all serious incidents occurring in operations or training and any and all emergency mission requests.

Supply (G4): In the rear with the gear, G4 is in charge of all the equipment needed by the Force at large. We provide uniforms, medals, and lots of other goodies to keep the GSDF looking sharp, strapped, and ready to go with the proper tools for any mission or task facing our soldiers.

Communications (G6): The Voice of Command, G6 maintains all communications equipment and standards, from radios to cell phone networks to the Internet. We also provide IT support to both headquarters and field units. 

Finance (G8): Every organization needs money to operate. We make sure the Force gets the most bang for its state buck. 

The Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps: Use your law school training in ways you never imagined. Serve your state as a military lawyer as part of the JAG Corps. Give legal advice to soldiers and help them navigate the corriders of the legal process. Vet plans and operations for the legal ramifications. Advise command staff on all matters legal. 

The Chaplains Corps: Serve the spiritual needs of your fellow soldiers as a chaplain (military religious leader) or chaplain’s assistant. Everywhere GSDF soldiers go, chaplains and their assistants are right there to minister to them. Whether it’s guiding trainees to complete their programs or head into a post-disaster area to support soldiers helping those in need, chaplains serve in myriad ways beyond the pulpit.
