**A Unique Mission**

Sometimes our call to service is not always in uniform.  Occasionally we need to play the role of a victim or even an active shooter.  As is the case in this mission for Cobb County and surrounding counties where we had the opportunity to help them exercise an active shooter scenario in an office highrise building.  

All the troops that participated thoroughly enjoyed getting the make-up and playing victim as well as learning how our fellow agencies handle these scenarios.  

**In the Future**

If we can help your EMA with training: from force on force all the way to role playing victims, please reach out to your local Georgia State Guard Rep to help!
