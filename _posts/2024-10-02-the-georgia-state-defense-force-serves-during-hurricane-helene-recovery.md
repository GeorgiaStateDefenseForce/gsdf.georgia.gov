In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) assisted the Georgia National Guard in providing recovery support in both north and south Georgia. The GSDF contributed to various operations, including those involving debris clearing and traffic control.

The GSDF is a component of the Georgia Department of Defense, along with the Georgia Air National Guard and Georgia Army National Guard.
