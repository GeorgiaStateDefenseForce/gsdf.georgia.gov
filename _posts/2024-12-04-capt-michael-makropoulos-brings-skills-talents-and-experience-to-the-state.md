*PAO Q&A by Capt. Beverly Shepard and Pvt. Ryan C. Thomas*

In case you missed it, WSB Radio (95.5) interviewed Capt. Michael Makropoulos earlier this year. Capt. Makropoulos has been a guest on multiple radio shows in the past. The WSB interview, which aired in July 2024, centered around his civilian work, but Capt. Makropoulos uses his skills to benefit the state of Georgia in many ways.

As a civilian, Capt. Makropoulos is a senior-level executive with nearly 50 years of security, operations and technology management experience. He has led many different groups, programs and initiatives, both nationally and internationally.

He owns Palisades International, an executive protection firm with more than 25 prior and active service military agents. The firm provides security for celebrities, elected officials, and dignitaries, and others.

His certifications include:

• U.S. Concealed Carry Association Instructor
• NRA Chief Range Safety Officer
• Engagement Skills Trainer II Advanced Warfare Weapons Simulator 
• Ammunition Supply Point Tactical Weapons Instructor
• Military Range Officer

In his GSDF capacity, Capt. Makropoulos serves as executive officer for GSDF Headquarters and Headquarters Company. 

Capt. Makropoulos is a coach for the Georgia National Guard Marksmanship team. He has assisted with the Andrew Sullens Marksmanship Competition (ASMC). He also assists with Georgia National Guard marksmanship training during the Small Arms Leadership Course, and he performs other marksmanship functions at Fort Stewart.

**Q1.   You own a security company. What skills does that allow you to use with your service to  the state of Georgia?** 

**A.**   I am a Georgia state arms instructor. I serve as Cadre for the Georgia National Guard Marksmanship unit at Fort Stewart, Ga. Each year, I instruct at the Small Arms Leadership Course twice—once in the spring and once in the fall. I have been doing this for the past 8 years or so. I specialize in the new SIG weapons platforms rolled out about two years ago, the M17 & M18 pistols.

**Q2. You assist with training with the Georgia National Guard. What type of training?**

**A.** Because of my private life of owning an Executive Protection firm, I was asked by the NCO 
      leadership of the National Guard 178th Military Police to come in and instruct on Protective 
      Security Detail (PSD) to 5 NCOs deploying this year to cover a senior officer overseas. I 
      went to their drill in March to instruct a basic course on Advance Work and Protective 
      Intelligence. The NCOs are then attending the PSD school in April. I will come in again in 
      May and teach an advanced course.

**Q3. Will you work with the upcoming Andrew Sullens Marksmanship Competition? In 
          what capacity?**

**A.**	I will serve as Cadre helping to run the state match, monitor for range safety, and simultaneously adding instruction, when needed.

**Q4.  Do you prefer to instruct or to participate in competitions. What drives your preference?**  

**A.**	I now prefer to instruct, although I still compete in civilian and protection industry matches a few times a year.

**Q5. Your WBS interview was in July. From a civilian perspective, have you done similar
          interviews?**  

**A.**   A few, over the years, but I am highly selective. We are called the “Quiet Professionals” because we seldom, if ever, talk about our protection details, clients, or other details about our industry.

**Q6. When did you join the GSDF? What motivates you to serve in the GSDF?**  

**A.**	I joined 10 years ago. Being a son of a career U.S. Army officer, I always wanted to serve.  After working 2 years in the Middle East as a security contractor as a young man, I  decided to pursue a civilian career in technology. After seeing the GSDF in action, I heard Maj. Clark Howard (GSDF, ret.) promoting the GSDF, and I joined.
