The year 2023 marked a milestone for Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) Soldier 2nd Lt.
John Bowers. In 2023, 2nd Lt. Bowers became the first GSDF Soldier to earn the
Governor’s Twenty in two categories—pistol and rifle—during the Andrew Sullens
Marksmanship Competition (ASMC).

The ASMC began in 2013. It is named for Georgia Army National Guard veteran, Andrew
Sullens. Wounded in Afghanistan in 2009, he remains a tireless advocate for joint
readiness and team-building. 

Although GSDF Soldiers had participated—in some form—since 2013, 2023 was the first
year that the GSDF entered a full, four-Soldier team. 

Also noteworthy, the GSDF team placed 3rd in the overall competition in 2023. Here was
the GSDF competition marksmanship team in 2023 (Ranks at that time): 

* 2nd Lt. John Bowers – 5BDE
* Pfc. Scott Lawler – 5BDE
* Command Sgt. Maj. Bill Ford – 5BDE
* Spc. Tom Peters – 5BDE 

Prior to 2nd Lt. Bowers, Staff Sgt. Jon Van Holm was the first and the only GSDF Soldier tabbed with the Governor’s Twenty. He earned his tab in 2019. The GSDF, itself, made history in 2019 by competing for the first time in the competition.

**Q&A with 2nd Lt. John Bowers**

1. **When (what age or year) did you begin to shoot? Where?** 

I got my first BB gun when I was eight years old.  Like most Georgia boys, I progressed to a .22 single shot rifle and then, when I could take the recoil, a 12-gauge shotgun.  I did a lot of plinking (shooting at cans) and eventually took up hunting. 

When I was old enough to drive and had some discretionary income, I got into competitive shooting in local (Southeastern U.S.) matches and eventually the National Matches (Camp Perry, Ohio).  I’ve competed, and placed, with all platforms (handgun, shotgun, and rifle) across a number of shooting games including bullseye oriented and combat oriented tournaments.  I earned a High Master classification (similar to the black belt classification in karate).  Because of my shooting credentials, the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) asked me, in 2006, to help train our Soldiers in precision shooting during the Global War on Terror. I trained 826 11 Bravos (combat riflemen) for the AMU.  Eighteen years later, I still coach precision shooters for the AMU.

2. **How regularly do you shoot/practice?**

I live on enough acreage to shoot on my property, but I prefer to shoot at my gun club, which is literally five minutes from my house.  It has facilities for handgun, shotgun, and rifle (out to 300 yards).  I shoot a couple of times a week.  However, you don’t really have to shoot as much as I do to maintain your skill level. You can get away with a lot of “dry firing” at home to keep your skill level up. (Dry firing involves going through your training drills without live ammunition and is extremely effective in burnishing muscle memory and the critical ability to call your shots). This training regime has allowed me to rank in the top 10%  in the United States.

3. **How (what ways) and how long did you prepare for the ASMC?** 

ASMC has its own rules, courses of fire, and nuances.  At the end of the day, it's really not significantly different from any of the competitions I’ve been in over the past 50 years, so there was no big change in my training plan.

4. **What was the most difficult part of the competition?**

Beyond question, it was the HEAT.  Fort Stewart is located in south Georgia, near the coast. The heat index is tremendous this time of year and hydration is critical. 

Dunk tanks filled with ice also allow you to “stay in the fight.” Putting your arms in the dunk tanks for 30 seconds cools enough of your circulating blood to keep your body temp somewhat normal.

5. **How did you manage to compete alongside other Soldiers, in terms of physical endurance, with these younger Soldiers?**

I am almost 70 years old.  My eyesight, muscle tone, and endurance aren’t what they once were. However, precision shooting is like any other athletic discipline. Technique, built over a half century, helps to offset age-related deficits.  

6. **Will you be involved this year (2024)?**

I’d like to. It depends on my schedule. If I can attend, I might contribute more to the GSDF in a pure coaching role (vs as an athlete putting up points on the board).

7. **How is the competition scored?**

ASMC is shot over many days, with both rifle and pistol, under many challenging courses of fire. There are individual matches and team matches (The GSDF team, made up of 5th Brigade Soldiers, came in 3rd place by the way; my fellow GSDF athletes were awesome!). The Governors Twenty tab is awarded to athletes that rank in the top 20 percent.

8. **What advice would you give others considering entering the competition?**

What advice would you give others preparing for competition? The first thing I would recommend is to go on the mission in a support role. That will allow you to learn, firsthand, what’s really involved. GSDF Soldiers help the Georgia Marksmanship Unit (our brothers/sisters in the GAANG that, along with GSDF help, run the match). Support activities include helping to build/setup/manage the
targetry, issue/track/control ammunition, and perform ad hoc tasks keep the mission running in a smooth manner.  As far as preparing for the competition, after you’ve served in the support role, I’d look into the GSDF marksmanship team. They practice regularly throughout the year.
