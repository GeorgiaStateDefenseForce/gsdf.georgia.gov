In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) Soldiers answered the call to serve Georgia and its citizens.

The [Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency](https://www.facebook.com/GeorgiaEMAHS?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZUcGDgq9lqBeVjGsGlk16d6Ghp60mNp2O_p0VjwMNRniD3G79Q5KJOZS7-hoB3yLiD_XkL3szhnfhXtEnlYWQ_llLOqeEJOMBof4w_epAaMO49c2dfJjrM-Hklz-rwPwb5sTyZQCanNtim8PI0SRu9j5ivJIor4AhgQcdvR4bgmLkdnzeNA1jbO2HedZqTCWcg&__tn__=-%5dK-R) led the state’s recovery efforts. The GSDF assisted the [Georgia National Guard](https://www.facebook.com/GeorgiaArmyNationalGuard?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZUcGDgq9lqBeVjGsGlk16d6Ghp60mNp2O_p0VjwMNRniD3G79Q5KJOZS7-hoB3yLiD_XkL3szhnfhXtEnlYWQ_llLOqeEJOMBof4w_epAaMO49c2dfJjrM-Hklz-rwPwb5sTyZQCanNtim8PI0SRu9j5ivJIor4AhgQcdvR4bgmLkdnzeNA1jbO2HedZqTCWcg&__tn__=-%5dK-R) with debris clearance, water distribution, and traffic control operations in both northern and southern portions of the state.

Hurricane Helene hit the coast of Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on September 26, 2024. It traveled north through portions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, leaving devastation in its path. It was the strongest hurricane on record to strike the [Big Bend region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_(Florida)) of Florida, the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since [Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria) in [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season), and the deadliest to strike the mainland United States since [Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) in [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season).

The GSDF began preparations before the hurricane made landfall, working with the Georgia National Guard in the Joint Operations Center at Clay National Guard Center in Marietta, Ga. GSDF Soldiers continued to volunteer with the Georgia National Guard days after the storm.

Gen. Jasmon Fryman.

Throughout the response, the GSDF personified its motto: Parati Servire!, meaning Ready to Serve! 

 “I could not be more proud of the men and women of Georgia’s State Defense Force and their selfless response to the citizens of the state,” said GSDF Commanding General Brig. Gen. Dennis Watts.
