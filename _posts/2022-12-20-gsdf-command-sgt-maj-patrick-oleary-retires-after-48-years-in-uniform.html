<p>"<span style="color: #222222;">It was my honor to be part of a great Soldier's career and retirement," said GSDF Commanding General Brig. Gen. Mark D. Gelhardt Sr. "CSM O'Leary was an outstanding senior noncommissioned officer and my right-hand Senior NCO for several years.  CSM O'Leary's well-deserved retirement—after so many years in uniform, both on active duty, as a Vietnam War veteran, and as the CSM of the Georgia State Defense Force—is a career that all should look at and want to emulate. CSM O'Leary is a true professional soldier who has led the way for all of us and has set standards that we should all try to meet."</span></p>
