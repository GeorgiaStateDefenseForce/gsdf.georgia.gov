Georgia State Defense Force's 5th Brigade (5BDE) was the first GSDF unit to be fully embedded with a National Guard Unit over 10 years ago and has been leading the way ever since.


Designated as "Vikings" in late 2020, 5BDE prides itself on attacking challenges and finding innovative ways to solve problems (just like the Northmen of old). We've gained a solid reputation across the state and are now requested by numerous Georgia Army National Guard (GAANG) units looking for an exceptional training partner that gets the job done whatever may come.


5BDE also leads the way in response to natural disasters. We maintain high training standards for all elements of [our METL](/pages/about.md/#basic-mission-essential-task-list-bmetl) and work hard to ensure we have the right gear in the right place when mother nature throws a tantrum. Our troops have reponded in times of need after hurricanes, tornados, icy roads and river floods. We strive to be the first boots on the ground setting up the most effective response possible.


The 5th brigade is made up of volunteers with variety of skillsets including law enforcement, electricians, IT professionals, engineers, truck drivers, chemists and educators. No matter what you background, there's a place to use your professional skills and blend them with new skills to serve the citizens of Georgia in their greatest times of need.

While all GSDF units can operate anywhere in the state, the Vikings Area of Operations (AO) runs across the state below I-2o and north of Albany. You could draw a loop including Carrollton, Lagrange, Columbus, Cordele, Hinesville and Augusta and just about encompass the area. With such a large geographic area to cover we have more than one drill station to work with. Our primary drill stations are shown below.

All 5th Brigade units support Direct Support of Civilian Authorities (DSCA), Community Engagement (COMENG), and Military to Military Support (MTMS).
5th Brigade leads the way in MTMS. The missions we undertake are highly varied and offer a challenging array of engagement involving opportunities for soldiers at all levels to develop skills, build relationships and contribute in a meaningful way to the citizens of Georgia when they need help most. Some examples of MTMS missions include:


 - Pre-mobilization Training and Assistance Element (PTAE) means helping troops identify areas of improvement as a starting point for advanced deployment training.
 - Small Arms Leaders Course (SALC) allows soldiers to support National Guard units as they advance their skills on live-fire ranges.
 - Andrew Sullens Marksmanship Competition lets soldiers engage in range support and includes a chance to compete if selected for the GSDF Competitive Marksmanship Team (CMT).
 - 1/54th Security Forces Assistance Brigade (SFAB) missions provide in-depth training in traditional combat tactics and small unit tactics as an avenue for SFAB soldiers to hone their skills before deployment to assist in training security forces for our allies in developing nations.

DSCA and COMENG are also significant parts of 5th Brigade’s mission set. In addition to cooperating with multiple Emergency Management Agencies (EMAs) we work with numerous government agencies and non-government organizations (NGOs). Some recent examples include:

  - Points of Distribution (PODs) operation
  - Food Bank relief box packing
  - Hurricane evacuation shelter support
  - Urban and Wilderness Search and Rescue (USAR / WSAR)
  - COVID-19 related missions embedded with National Guard units.
