# GSDF Band & Chorus

## The GSDF Band & Chorus perform music support missions for
- GSDF Troops—Graduations, ceremonies, protocol functions, and funeral/memorial services, and
- Community Relations/Outreach—Concerts, patriotic observances (e.g., Memorial Day, Independence Day, Veteran’s Day) and other special events for cities, towns, and municipalities.

## At full capacity, the GSDF Band & Chorus will support multiple music missions, including
- A concert band to perform concert literature and ceremonial music,
- Brass and woodwind chamber ensembles (quintets—brass/woodwind choirs or larger),
- Large and small music ensembles (a combo-type group)—rhythm section with or without vocals and/or horns (saxophone, trumpet, trombone) to perform contemporary and popular music,
- A Chorus to perform separately, or jointly with components of the band, to support various activities,
- A colonial music ensemble (fife and drum) (attired in 18th-century-era period uniforms), and
- A funeral support element (buglers).
