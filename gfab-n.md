            <td>Monthly drill locations vary with the planned training. Locations include, Dawson Forest (Atlanta Tract), Pine Valley Recreation Center (Dahlonega), Yonah Preserve (Cleveland) as well as more remote areas in the North Georgia Mountains. Able Company training consists of all the METL for the GSDF but has a focus on Wilderness Search and Rescue because of our proximity to the mountains, Appalachian Trail system and other hiking trails. Drills are normally the third full weekend of the month (Charlie weekend), physical by the nature of our training and usually include a bivouac between day one and two of training. If you are looking for a way to serve the citizens of Georgia that is both demanding and rewarding, Able Company might be the challenge you are looking for. </td>
