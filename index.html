								<strong>To the Citizens of Georgia,</strong>

								<p>Georgia stands as a beacon of strength, resilience, and unity. The Georgia State Defense Force is committed to protecting our communities, serving our neighbors, and upholding the values that define us as proud Georgians.</p>

								<p>Today, I invite you to join us in this vital mission.</p>

								<p>The Army Values—<strong>loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage</strong>—are the foundation of our force. As volunteers, you will live out these principles: demonstrating loyalty to our state, fulfilling your duty to safeguard our citizens, and showing respect to every Georgian.</p>

								<p>Selfless service means placing others before yourself—whether by delivering aid to those in need or helping communities rebuild in the aftermath of disaster. Honor and integrity compel us to do what is right, even when no one is watching. And personal courage gives us the strength to face any crisis—floods, hurricanes, or emergencies—with confidence and resolve.</p>

								<p><strong>Our mission is rooted in community.</strong></p>

								<p>When disaster strikes, we respond—distributing essential supplies, providing aid, and supporting the most vulnerable among us. In times of calm, we foster trust, engage in outreach, and strengthen the connections that make Georgia unbreakable.</p>

								<p>We ensure that no one is left behind.</p>

								<p>Becoming a member of the Georgia State Defense Force is more than a commitment—it’s a legacy. You will receive meaningful training, grow as a leader, and make an impact that echoes across our state for generations to come.</p>

								<p>Be the helping hands. The compassionate hearts. The unshakable courage.</p>

								<p><strong>Georgia needs you.
								Will you answer the call?</strong></p>

								<p>Let’s serve our state—<strong>together</strong></p>
